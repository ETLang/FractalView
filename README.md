# FractalView
Fractal View allows you to view Mandelbrot and Julia fractals rendered in real-time, up to zoom levels of around 10 trillion.

Things to do:
- Play around with the values of Cr and Ci to alter the shape of the fractal.
- Increase Max I to get more fine details. Decrease Max I to improve performance.
- Adjust the gradient spread to highlight detail
- Switch between the classic "thumbprint" Mandelbrot set and burning ship fractal
- Zoom and pan using mouse/touch

In Progress:
- Save as PNG for wallpaper/lock screen/whatever you like
- Save a high-quality TIFF suitable for printing and framing.

Coming soon: 
- Configurable color gradients
- Additional visualization modes
- Bookmarks and slideshow
